        "    - A Python interpreter is a program that directly executes Python code. Unlike compiled languages, which are entirely converted into machine code before execution, Python is an interpreted language. This means the interpreter reads your Python code, analyzes it, and executes it directly, line by line.\n",

        "      - NO, keywords cannot be used as variable names. Keywords, also known as reserved words, are predefined words with specific meanings in a programming language and are reserved for that purpose. Using them as variable names would lead to syntax errors because the compiler or interpreter would recognize them as keywords, not as user-defined variable names.\n",

If an object is mutable, you can change its contents or structure without creating a new object in memory. This means that operations like adding elements, removing elements, or changing existing elements directly modify the original object.\n",

        "      * Internally, Python stores list elements in a resizable array in memory. This allows to Add, Remove or Change elements freely by using methods like '.append()', '.pop()', '.insert()'.\n",

        "        \n",
        "      -  Why Tuples Are Immutable:\n",
        "      * A Tuple is a static data structure = that's intended to hold fixed data.\n",
